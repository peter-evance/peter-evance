<h3 align="center">Software Engineer || Animal Scientist</h3>

### 🙋‍♂️ About Me:
<p align="justify">
I'm a certified software engineer with a strong foundation in animal science. Passionate about coding for precision livestock agriculture projects, I strive to merge my expertise in both fields. I am a continuous learner, always seeking new challenges to evolve as a Full Stack Developer. When not immersed in code, I actively contribute as an online volunteer, known for exceptional teamwork. Let's connect and chat about technology, agriculture, or anything in between! 🌐💻🐄
